## Analysing Data Repository

This repository contains the datasets and notebooks used for the assignments of the Digital Humanities course Analysing Data.

The subdirectories are named relative to the assignments and each consist of another subdirectory called `data` which contains the datasets.
They each also include a .ipynb file named `code` consisting of the code used to process the data.
